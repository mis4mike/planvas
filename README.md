planvas
=======

This is the beginnings of a garden planning tool using the HTML5 Canvas element. It's very much a work in progress.

Things to do:

Adjust the growing season based on hemisphere, distance to the equator and (maybe) altitude.
Add other climate stuff like rainfall, etc.
Create a DB of plants that can be added to the planvas. Have it auto-select plants based on climate.
Add bands around the outside of the plan for each plant.

Maybe some day:

Auto-generate an ical
Integrate with garden automation software/hardware
